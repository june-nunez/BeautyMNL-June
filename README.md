# BeautyMnl-June
BeautyMnl assessment code exam for June Nu√±ez

## Design Pattern Used
### MVVM
* Used on a couple of components to separate the logic from the UI thus making it reusable. Can also be helpful to reduce clutter in the controllers.

## Dependencies
### `LBTATools`
* Contains extensions and classes to speed up UI development
* I programmatically created the UI for this project to showcase my understanding of how UIKit works.

### `NotificationBannerSwift`
* Customizable and lightweight library that makes the task of displaying in app notification banners and drop down alerts a breeze.
